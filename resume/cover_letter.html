Dear B12 Engineering Team,
</p>

<p>
I’m excited to apply for the Full Stack Engineer (Backend Emphasis) role at B12. I’m a backend-leaning full stack engineer with over ten years of experience building production systems, data platforms, and product infrastructure that support real users and business outcomes.
</p>

<p>
At CCR Technologies, I’ve spent the last several years architecting and delivering backend systems end-to-end. This includes designing schemas and APIs, building ingestion and automation pipelines, deploying microservices on Kubernetes, and ensuring data and services are reliable and easy for teams to build on. Recently, I designed and built an internal content intelligence platform using MongoDB to orchestrate web-scraped data alongside vendor datasets, and paired it with a Typesense search layer that enables fast fuzzy search and interactive querying across large volumes of content.
</p>

<p>
What draws me to B12 is the focus on software as a craft combined with a mission centered on helping people do meaningful work. I enjoy working across the stack, but I’m most energized by building strong backend foundations that enable product teams to move quickly and confidently. B12’s emphasis on continuous delivery, strong testing culture, and thoughtful technology choices closely aligns with how I approach building systems.
</p>

<p>
I’m particularly excited by B12’s blend of research, engineering, and product development, and the way those efforts are translated into real-world tools like Orchestra. The opportunity to contribute to systems that empower people while continuously learning and teaching within the team is very appealing to me.
</p>

<p>
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in backend systems, data orchestration, and product-focused engineering could contribute to B12’s continued growth.
</p>
